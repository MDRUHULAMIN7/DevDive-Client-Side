                <p className="mt-20 mb-16 text-xl font-medium">As we continue to grow our
                    base of Reddit advertisers, we’re committed to ensuring that everyone has all of the tools and resources
                    at their fingertips to maximize their Reddit investment. Today, we’re introducing Reddit’s Official
                    Partner Badging Program, a program for agency partners to earn exclusive badges on their path of
                    becoming Reddit certified experts. <span className="text-red-500">Reddit Ads Formula initially launched in June 2022 and then in
                        October 2023 we launched a second module, the “Boost 2.0 Certification Program.”</span> This new program is
                    rolling out as a pilot, but we’ve already seen partners such as Just Global, Aleph, Omni Advertising,
                    GroupM, Tinuiti, BVK, Furman Roth, and InHouse Agency dive in and continue deepening their knowledge
                    of Reddit Ads.</p>

                <p className="text-2xl font-bold">Badge up and join the conversation</p>

                <p className="mt-20 mb-16 text-xl font-medium text-red-500">As part of the Partner Badging Program, we’ve customized different badges for each type of partner based on what Reddit Ads Formula certifications they’ve acquired and their
                    overall investment. Certified Sales Partners who meet one of these requirements will receive a
                    shareable digital badge. Those who meet both of the requirements will be designated as a “Certified
                    Sales Gold Partner,” and be featured on our Reddit for Business website.</p>
